# 👋 Hi, I'm Silvano Picard

I am a Computer Science student at the University of Buenos Aires (UBA), currently in my third year of studies.
My academic and personal interests lie in understanding computation from an applied perspective, particularly in exploring how machine learning can address real-world problems.

## Technical Background

Programming Languages: Python, C

## Current Project

* I am developing an end-to-end deep learning system for the RIVA Cervical Cytology Challenge (ISBI 2026), focused on nucleus detection and fine-grained cell classification in high-resolution Pap smear images. Stay tuned!

## Upcoming Projects

* SIMD-optimized K-means implementation, focused on improving vectorized performance, to be later applied for portfolio optimization based on risk metrics such as Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR).
