ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Silvano Picard

I am a Computer Science student at the University of Buenos Aires (UBA), currently in my second year of studies.
My academic and personal interests lie in understanding computation from both a theoretical and applied perspective, particularly in exploring how formal reasoning and machine learning can address real-world problems.

ðŸŽ¯ Research and Academic Interests

Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence â€“ applying computational models to practical domains and analyzing their theoretical underpinnings.

Theoretical Computer Science â€“ with a focus on type theory, formal systems, and interactive theorem provers.

ðŸ§° Technical Background

Programming Languages: Haskell, Python, C, intermediate x86 assembly, and basic Agda.

ðŸš€ Upcoming Projects

* SIMD-optimized K-means implementation, focused on improving vectorized performance, to be later applied for portfolio optimization based on risk metrics such as Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR).
